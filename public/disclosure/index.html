    <h1>Disclosure</h1>
    <p>Some outbound links on Greedy may lead to commercial partners.</p>
    <p>If we receive compensation, it does not change the scoring model or the order in which products appear.</p>
    <p>The goal is to keep rankings data-driven and consistent across products and countries.</p>
